What is a Finite State Machine???

A finite state machine (FSM) is a mathematical model used to represent and analyze the behavior of systems that can be in one of a finite set of states at any given time. An FSM consists of a finite number of states, transitions between those states, and input symbols or events that cause the transitions.

The states represent the different conditions or situations that the system can be in, while the transitions represent the changes from one state to another in response to input signals or events. The input symbols or events trigger the transitions and determine the behavior of the system.

FSMs are used in a variety of fields, including computer science, electrical engineering, and control systems engineering. They are often used to model digital circuits, software algorithms, and communication protocols. FSMs can also be used to model complex systems by decomposing them into smaller sub-systems and modeling each sub-system with its own FSM.

Finite State Machines (FSMs) are widely used in a variety of applications to model systems with a finite number of states and transitions between those states. Some common applications of FSM projects include:

•	Digital circuit design: FSMs can be used to design digital circuits, including sequential logic circuits, state machines, and control systems.

•	Game development: FSMs can be used to model the behavior of non-player characters (NPCs) in video games, allowing for more realistic and dynamic gameplay.

•	Language processing: FSMs can be used in natural language processing (NLP) to build models for text classification, part-of-speech tagging, and named entity recognition.

•	Network protocols: FSMs can be used to model network protocols, including TCP/IP, HTTP, and FTP, to ensure proper communication and error handling.

•	Compiler design: FSMs are used in compilers to analyze the syntax of programming languages and generate machine code.

•	Traffic light control: FSMs can be used to control traffic lights, optimizing the flow of traffic based on current conditions.

•	Robotics: FSMs can be used to model the behavior of robots, allowing them to perform tasks in a structured and efficient manner.

•	Elevator Controller: Design a finite state machine that models the operation of an elevator controller. The controller should receive input from the buttons inside the elevator and outside the elevator to move the elevator to the desired floor.

•	Washing Machine: Design a finite state machine that models the operation of a washing machine. The machine should accept input for the type of wash cycle, water temperature, and duration of the cycle.

•	Automated Teller Machine (ATM): Design a finite state machine that models the operation of an ATM. The machine should accept input for account number, PIN, and transaction type.

•	Game of Tic Tac Toe: Design a finite state machine that models the operation of a game of Tic Tac Toe. The machine should accept input for each player's move and determine the winner based on the rules of the game.

•	Digital Alarm Clock: Design a finite state machine that models the operation of a digital alarm clock. The machine should accept input for the desired alarm time and be able to sound the alarm at the designated time.

•	Car Door Controller: Design a finite state machine that models the operation of a car door controller. The controller should receive input from the door locks and unlock the doors accordingly.

•	Music Player: Implement a Finite State Machine that simulates a music player. The player should have different states, such as play, pause, stop, and skip, and should respond to user input to change states.
